    "# What is version control?\n",
    "Many people’s version control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version control**, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops) teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members."

    "For almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected. For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. The code for a project, app or software component is typically organized in a folder structure or \"file tree\". One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code, each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team. Further, in all software development, any change can introduce new bugs on its own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. So testing and development proceed together until a new version is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good version control software supports a developer's preferred workflow without imposing one particular way of working. Ideally it also works on any platform, rather than dictate what operating system or tool chain developers must use. Great version control systems facilitate a smooth and continuous flow of changes to the code rather than the frustrating and clumsy mechanism of file locking - giving the green light to one developer at the expense of blocking the progress of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users or the creation of incompatible changes between two unrelated pieces of work that must then be painstakingly untangled and reworked. If you're a developer who has never used version control you may have added versions to your files, perhaps with suffixes like \"final\" or \"latest\" and then had to later deal with a new final version. Perhaps you've commented out code blocks because you want to disable certain functionality without deleting the code, fearing that there may be a use for it later. Version control is a way out of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control software is an essential part of the every-day of the modern software team's professional practices. Individual software developers who are accustomed to working with a capable version control system in their teams typically recognize the incredible value version control also gives them even on small solo projects. Once accustomed to the powerful benefits of version control systems, many developers wouldn't consider working without it even for non-software projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Benefits of version control systems\n",
    "Using version control software is a best practice for high performing software and [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops) teams. Version control also helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version Control Systems (VCS) have seen great improvements over the past few decades and some are better than others. VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System). One of the most popular VCS tools in use today is called Git. Git is a Distributed VCS, a category known as DVCS, more on that later. Like many of the most popular VCS systems available today, Git is free and open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of what they are called, or which system is used, the primary benefits you should expect from version control are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A complete long-term change history of every file.** This means every change made by many individuals over the years. Changes include the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to their contents. Different VCS tools differ on how well they handle renaming and moving of files. This history should also include the author, date and written notes on the purpose of each change. Having the complete history enables going back to previous versions to help in root cause analysis for bugs and it is crucial when needing to fix problems in older versions of software. If the software is being actively worked on, almost everything can be considered an \"older version\" of the software.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Branching and merging.** Having team members work concurrently is a no-brainer, but even individuals working on their own can benefit from the ability to work on independent streams of changes. Creating a \"branch\" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent from each other while also providing the facility to merge that work back together, enabling developers to verify that the changes on each branch do not conflict. Many software teams adopt a practice of branching for each feature or perhaps branching for each release, or both. There are many different workflows that teams can choose from when they decide how to make use of branching and merging facilities in VCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traceability.** Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics. Having the annotated history of the code at your fingertips when you are reading the code, trying to understand what it is doing and why it is so designed can enable developers to make correct and harmonious changes that are in accord with the intended long-term design of the system. This can be especially important for working effectively with legacy code and is crucial in enabling developers to estimate future work with any accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to develop software without using any version control, doing so subjects the project to a huge risk that no professional team would be advised to accept. So the question is not whether to use version control but which version control system to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many choices, but here we are going to focus on just one, Git."

    "# What is `git`?\n",
    "<img src=\"graphics/gitlogo.png\" width=\"15%\"/>\n",
    "By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with the following attributes in mind:\n",
    "* **Performance.** The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. Committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security.** Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority. The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. This protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexibility.** One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects: in support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols. Git has been designed to support branching and tagging as first-class citizens (unlike SVN) and operations that affect branches and tags (such as merging or reverting) are also stored as part of the change history. Not all version control systems feature this level of tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git is a de facto standard** and is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. If you are an inexperienced developer wanting to build up valuable skills in AI and software development tools, when it comes to version control, Git should be on your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a very well supported open source project with over a decade of solid stewardship. The project maintainers have shown balanced judgment and a mature approach to meeting the long term needs of its users with regular releases that improve usability and functionality. The quality of the open source software is easily scrutinized and countless businesses rely heavily on that quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git enjoys great community support and a vast user base. Documentation is excellent and plentiful, including books, tutorials and dedicated web sites. There are also podcasts and video tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being open source lowers the cost for hobbyist developers as they can use Git without paying a fee. For use in open-source projects, Git is undoubtedly the successor to the previous generations of successful open source version control systems, SVN and CVS."

    "# Why use version control and Git?\n",
    "#### Feature Branch Workflow\n",
    "One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <center><img src=\"graphics/feature_branch_workflow.svg\" width=\"50%\"/></center>\n",
    "    <center><figcaption></figcaption></center>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase. When a developer wants to start working on something—no matter how big or small—they create a new branch. This ensures that the main branch always contains production-quality code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using feature branches is not only more reliable than directly editing production code, but it also provides organizational benefits. They let you represent development work at the same granularity as the your [agile backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs). For example, you might implement a policy where each [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) ticket is addressed in its own feature branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributed Development\n",
    "In SVN, each developer gets a working copy that points back to a single central repository. Git, however, is a distributed version control system. Instead of a working copy, each developer gets their own local repository, complete with a full history of commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <center><img src=\"graphics/distributed_development.svg\" width=\"70%\"/></center>\n",
    "    <center><figcaption></figcaption></center>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a full local history makes Git fast, since it means you don’t need a network connection to create commits, inspect previous versions of a file, or perform diffs between commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed development also makes it easier to scale your engineering team. If someone breaks the production branch in SVN, other developers can’t check in their changes until it’s fixed. With Git, this kind of blocking doesn’t exist. Everybody can continue going about their business in their own local repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, similar to feature branches, distributed development creates a more reliable environment. Even if a developer obliterates their own repository, they can simply clone someone else’s and start anew.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pull Requests\n",
    "Many source code management tools such as [Github.com](https://github.com) enhance core Git functionality with pull requests. A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository. This not only makes it easier for project leads to keep track of changes, but also lets developers initiate discussions around their work before integrating it with the rest of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <center><img src=\"graphics/pull_requests.svg\" width=\"50%\"/></center>\n",
    "    <center><figcaption></figcaption></center>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they’re essentially a comment thread attached to a feature branch, pull requests are extremely versatile. When a developer gets stuck with a hard problem, they can open a pull request to ask for help from the rest of the team. Alternatively, junior developers can be confident that they aren’t destroying the entire project by treating pull requests as a formal code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Community\n",
    "In many circles, Git has come to be the expected version control system for new projects. If your team is using Git, odds are you won’t have to train new hires on your workflow, because they’ll already be familiar with distributed development.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <center><img src=\"graphics/community.svg\" width=\"30%\"/></center>\n",
    "    <center><figcaption></figcaption></center>\n",
    "</figure>\n",

    "# How `git` works\n",
    "#### Git generally only adds data\n",
    "When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you haven’t committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes using Git a joy because we know we can experiment without the danger of severely screwing things up. For a more in-depth look at how Git stores its data and how you can recover data that seems lost, see [Undoing Things](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/_undoing).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The three states\n",
    "Pay attention now — here is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: **modified**, **staged**, and **committed**:\n",
    "* **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.\n",
    "* **Staged** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.\n",
    "* **Committed** means that the data is safely stored in your local database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and the Git directory.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <center><img src=\"graphics/areas.png\" width=\"55%\"/></center>\n",
    "    <center><figcaption><bold>Working tree, staging area, and Git directory.</bold></figcaption></center>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic Git workflow goes something like this:\n",
    "1. You **modify** files in your working tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You selectively **stage** just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You do a **commit**, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered committed. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified. In Git Basics, you’ll learn more about these states and how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely."

    "By default, your repository has one branch named `main` that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of `main` in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `main`.\n",
